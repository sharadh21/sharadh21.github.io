# Who Are You?
## Introduction
Do you remember the first time you got an identity  card? Maybe it was at school, a small badge with your name and photo. As you grew, you got one for college, and later, one for work. But beyond these visible IDs, we carry invisible ones too, our roles as a sibling, friend, parent, man or woman. These roles shape not only how the world sees us but also how we see ourselves. 
Shakespeare captured this so well in As You Like It:
< "All the world’s a stage,
And all the men and women merely players;
They have their exits and their entrances;
And one man in his time plays many parts." >
—An excerpt from All the world’s a stage (from As You Like It, spoken by Jaques to Duke Senior) William Shakespeare
