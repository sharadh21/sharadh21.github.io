<p>Welcome to my website! </p>

<p>I am Dr. Sharadh Hombal, a doctor helping make lives better, and a human trying to decode life.</p>

<p>I have completed my medical school and I am looking forward to doing post graduation in General Medicine. I'm an avid learner of new things. Photography, coin collecting, art and philosophy are some of my interests. 
Join me as I learn more about the world and try to understand it by writing about it in this blog.</p>
